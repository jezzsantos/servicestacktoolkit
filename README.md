ServiceStack Toolkit
===================

A Developer Toolkit for building ServiceStack web services.

The toolkit is focused on applying good REST design rules, from teh point of view of 'resources' and basic GET, POST, PUT, DELETE verbs. Based upon simple configuration, the toolkit automates the creation of much of the plumbing and coding required to construct a fully functioning web service of your choice (from front to back). Including creating basic unit and integration tests.
