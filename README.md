ServiceStack Toolkit
===================

A developer toolkit (for Visual Studio 2013) for building ServiceStack web services.

The toolkit is focused on applying good REST design rules, from the point of view of 'resources' with basic verbs: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. 

The toolkit applies many of the recommended practices and patterns evolving in the ServiceStack community, by those experts in the community, for both REST service design and implementation of REST services using the excellent ServiceStack framework. There is no easier way to get started with creating, and maintaining your web service with ServiceStack.

Based upon simple configuration by the developer, the toolkit automates the creation of much of the plumbing and coding of the web service required to construct a fully functioning web service of your choice (from front to back). Including creating basic unit and integration tests. All that remains is for you (the developer) to code the logic and behavior of the web service, let the toolkit take care of the rest.
